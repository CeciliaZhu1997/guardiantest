    "maintext": "A former Nationals MP who quit the party due to its opposition to an Indigenous voice to parliament says sceptics will be proven wrong about the proposal.\nAndrew Gee, who quit the party in December and now sits on the crossbench as an independent, has joined Indigenous Australians minister Linda Burney in regional New South Wales as the “yes” campaign kicks off.\nGee said people who had opposed the high court’s Mabo decision, which recognised Indigenous land rights, were proven wrong about the implications and the same would happen with the voice.\n“Sceptics out there, once this voice is implemented, will see that this is not a scary thing, this is not a bad moment for our history, this is an uplifting moment for our history,” he told reporters in Orange on Monday.\n“We want this to be a true community conversation and it should be a moment in our history to celebrate and not to divide.\n“I just hope that the sceptics will approach this with an open mind and an open heart.”\nEarlier, the leader of the Nationals, David Littleproud, told Sky News the voice would create an extra layer of bureaucracy that wouldn’t help advance better outcomes for Indigenous people.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoonemail newsletters for your daily news roundup\nBut Burney labelled the comments as “misinformation” and “scaremongering”.\nSupporters of the Indigenous voice to parliament have launched a week of action to help Australians understand the proposal and answer questions about its purpose.\nIt is part of a push to start a conversation on the voice in communities, rather than politicians and media commentators dominating talks.\nFrom the Heart’s director, Dean Parkin, who was closely involved in the process that resulted in the Uluru statement, said he wanted Australians in all communities to be involved in the reconciliation process of constitutional recognition.\n“It’s time to bring the conversation … back to where it should be: in communities across the country,” he told ABC radio on Monday.\n“That’s where this whole idea started from and that’s where we know the campaign will be won.”\nA series of online “yarning circles” with voice advocates have been launched to give Australians the opportunity to have their questions answered.\nBurney said anyone who argued there was not enough detail about the voice should “do a bit of work”.\nShe recommended people take part in the yarning circles and visit the Uluru statement from the heart website.\nProf Megan Davis, co-chair of the statement’s cultural authority Uluru Dialogue and a member of the government’s referendum working group, said there had been huge demand for the sessions.\nYet constitutional lawyer Greg Craven, a member of the constitutional expert group providing advice to the referendum working group, said “referendum factions” were obstructing progress.\nIn a piece published by the Australian newspaper, he claimed one “determined bloc” was demanding little detail so it could dictate the model after the referendum.\n“There are others who would see the referendum go down unless it reflects their own vision of the voice,” he wrote.\nBut Davis said there were no factions within the referendum working group.\n“The people that I sit among in those working groups have devoted their lives to the service of their communities and they’re certainly not people who would want to hamper this referendum.”",
