    "maintext": "The federal government has considered transforming quarantine facilities built during the pandemic into emergency shelters for people fleeing domestic violence, according to documents obtained under freedom of information laws.\nThe documents show the federal government – which built the facilities so international arrivals could safely isolate for two weeks before entering the community – has also considered using them to house skilled migrants who can address critical skills gaps.\n“We would be open to considering future use proposals from the state governments for accommodation for people affected by domestic and family violence who require emergency accommodation,” said a briefing document prepared for ministers late last year.\n“Future use proposals will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis noting that the design of the centres provides for strict infection prevention and control mechanisms and opens up possibilities to support: state health systems including, for health emergencies, humanitarian efforts, and temporary or crisis accommodation.”\nThe facilities collectively cost more than $1bn and were designed to replace the initial hotel quarantine scheme, which some doctors described as a disaster. But the briefing document describes the quarantine centres as long-term assets that could be used to respond to many challenges beyond Covid-19.\n“Usage of the centres as temporary accommodation to support skilled worker migration could be considered as part of this,” the document said.\n“Any alternative uses will not inhibit the ability of the centres to be stood up for quarantine if required.”\nFinance minister Katy Gallagher said the Albanese government “inherited these centres” and that it was determined to ensure they were available for future quarantine use “but also serve the community in times of need”.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoonemail newsletters for your daily news roundup\nBen Carblis, Mission Australia’s manager of community services, said a “severe shortage” of housing meant many “women and children often stayed in a violent home just to avoid homelessness”.\n“The repurposing of these buildings into emergency accommodation would potentially help increase local accommodation for people escaping domestic and family violence,” Carblis said.\n“We welcome all suggestions for additional housing, but it is important that any buildings made available for people escaping domestic and family violence are complemented with onsite wrap-around specialist support services, such as case management, counselling and practical supports, so everyone’s support needs are met.”\nThe Save the Children strategy and public affairs executive director, Aram Hosie, said any crisis accommodation must ensure a safe, secure and supportive environment where children’s needs are also met.\n“There is a massive shortage of accommodation for women and children escaping domestic and family violence, which in turn causes significant harm to children and contributes to the vicious cycle between violence and poverty,” Hosie said.\n“It’s important that accommodation be suitable for children as well as adult women, given that children are directly impacted by violence in their own right. Working directly with children in the design of the spaces could be one way to ensure that they feel welcoming and safe.”\nIn October last year, the federal government approved a request by the Victorian government to use the Mickleham quarantine facility in response to devastating floods.\nJust weeks earlier the Victorian police minister, Anthony Carbines, said the quarantine hub had “served its purpose” but would continue to exist as “an insurance policy” for future pandemics or emergencies.\nMore than 200 people stayed at the $560m facility, which will be handed back to the federal government next month.\nIn July last year, the Queensland government also decided there was “no longer a public health requirement for dedicated, government-provided quarantine and isolation facilities”.\nFederal ministers were told not to interpret Queensland’s decision as a sign the facilities were a waste of money.\n“The centres were always envisaged as being enduring assets, under commonwealth ownership, and as such they can be used to respond to future crises beyond Covid-19.”",
